[Apache Maven][maven] is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. Maven projects are configured using a Project Object Model stored in a `pom.xml` file.

This package provides the latest release of Maven built directly from its [source code][source] on GitHub. If the [OpenJDK Snap package][openjdk] is also installed, this package connects to it during installation for the location of its Java Development Kit runtime and tools.
