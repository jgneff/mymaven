summary: Apache Maven for the OpenJDK Snap
description: |
  Apache Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java
  projects. Maven can also be used to build and manage projects
  written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. Maven projects
  are configured with a Project Object Model (POM) in a 'pom.xml' file.

  This package provides Maven for Linux and uses the OpenJDK Snap
  package, if installed, when the JAVA_HOME environment variable
  is not set. Building this package downloads the Maven source code
  directly from the Apache Web site, verifies its SHA-512 hash value,
  and builds Maven from source using the Ubuntu Maven package.

  For more information, see the repository for this package on GitHub:

  https://github.com/jgneff/mymaven
